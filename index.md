## Welcome to Middle Author Bioinformatics

Over the past decade, sequencing has become cheap and accessible. However, data analysis is time and labor-intensive. Why get bogged down in the technical details and bioinformatics methods/pipelines that are required for analysis? Because it's fun? Maybe. But if you don't have a background in programming and bioinformatics, the learning curve to get any analysis done is steep.

Middle Author Bioinformatics services include consultation, data analysis, custom software and pipeline development, as well as collaboration. Additionally, we offer personalized training workshops that can be lab or department-wide. In addition to programming and bioinformatics, we are trained biologists, with many years of experience in microbiology, microbial ecology, evolutionary biology, and geomicrobiology. All services include a 24/7 direct line of communication - in other words, the analysis will not take a ‘one-size-fits-all’ or ‘plug-and-chug’ approach. Rather, it will be highly customized to the needs of the data and, importantly, the science.

If you are interested, please contact us for a complimentary consultation. We'd would be happy to discuss your data and research questions. This can be a discussion regarding broad questions like the range of analyses that can be done with the data. It can also be more specific.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Arkadiy-Garber/ArkBioinformatics/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Support or Contact
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Arkadiy-Garber/ArkBioinformatics/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

Having trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://docs.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) or [contact support](https://support.github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.
